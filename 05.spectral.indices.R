#matogrosso is a brazilian deforested island, in this case the images are from nasa earth observatory regardinf
#let's import the data, 30 m resolution (sentinel was 10m)

# 1=NIR, 2=RED, 3=GREEN

# or also written as
im.plotRGB(m1992, 1, 2, 3)
#the red we get is tropical forest, in 1992 they had already stareÃ¬ted to build
#we put nir on top of the green:
im.plotRGB(m1992, 2, 1, 3)
or
im.plotRGB(m1992, r=2, g=1, b=3) 
#nir on top of the blue:
im.plotRGB(m1992, r=2, g=3, b=1) 
#water should be black but it appaears similar to soil (it is polluted with particles
#let's see the same image in 2006

#the yellow color, once again, catches our eyes more than other colors and enhances the soil consumption of the area
#let's try to calculate the same index for vegetation for the two different years

#we're gonna rescale by using bits (shannon)--Z every piece of infomation can either be 0 or 1 (binary code)

#many info is stored in 8 bit

#here we don't have rgb, but a single layer (from the subtraction nir-red)
#for dvi2006:

#NDVI used for plant diversity, ranges from -1 to 1 (riguardare)
#to get ndvi= you normalize the subtraction (NIR-RED) by the sum of NIR+RED
#less related to n of bits, dvi depends on the ??, ndvi has always the same range
#to calculate ndvi:

ndvi1992= dvi1992/(m1992[[1]]+m1992[[2]])
