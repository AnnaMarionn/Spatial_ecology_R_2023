#matogrosso is a brazilian deforested island, in this case the images are from nasa earth observatory regardinf
#let's import the data, 30 m resolution (sentinel was 10m)

#we put nir on top of the green:

#water should be black but it appaears similar to soil (it is polluted with particles

#the yellow color, once again, catches our eyes more than other colors and enhances the soil consumption of the area
#let's try to calculate the same index for vegetation for the two different years
